// Book Allocation Problem
// There are N books, each "i"th book has A[i] number of pages.
// You have to allocate books to M number of students so that 
// the maximum number of pages allocated to a student is minimum.

// Note:
// • Each book should be allocated to a student.
// • Each student has to be allocated at least one book.
// • Allotment should be in contiguous order.

// Calculate and return that minimum possible number.
// Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible.
